        <span class="band-name">BABYMETAL</span>, or
        <span class="band-name">ベビーメタル (Bebīmetaru)</span> in Japanese, is
        a Japanese metal group formed in 2010. It was initially created as a
        trio consisting of Suzuka 'Su-Metal' Nakomoto, Yui 'Yuimetal' Mizuno and
        Moa 'Moametal' Kikuchi. It was produced by Kobametal from the Amuse
        talent agency. Babymetal became an independent act in 2013, following
        Nakamoto's departure from Sakura Gakuin. <br />

        Babymetal is known as a pioneer of a metal music subgenre known as
        Kawaii Metal. It mixes the heavy metal music, and its different
        subgenres, with J-Pop, making a big contrasts between vocals and
        instrumental. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Babymetal is backed up by a band known as a Kamiband, that plays the
        instrumental for their studio albums and during their live performances.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the iconic elements of Babymetal is choreographed dancing they
        perform during each of their live performances, and each song uses
        different choreography.

          one of the backup dancers that performed with Babymetal since
          Yuimetal's departure, became an official third member under the stage
          name of Momometal.
